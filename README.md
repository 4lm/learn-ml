# Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning Machine Learning through notes, code snippets, and hands-on projects. To deepen my understanding I’m exploring foundational concepts and practical applications. My starting point is Andrew Ng’s [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) on Coursera, and I plan to explore additional resources over time. Here are the courses I worked through so far:

1. [x] [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/031b40b2a083b0a15819b6f99447b333) earned 2024-11-04
2. [x] [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms), [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/69b0d45654610e1f2c89aa2087df81e2) earned 2024-12-09
3. [x] [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning), [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/99605f8ab605accf8740256ffe3b1723), earned 2025-05-09
